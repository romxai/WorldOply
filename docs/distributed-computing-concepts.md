# Distributed Computing Concepts in WorldOply

This document outlines the key distributed computing concepts utilized in the WorldOply ecosystem, explaining how they are implemented and their advantages/disadvantages.

## WebSockets

**Implementation:**
- Frontend: Using Socket.IO client in `realtimeService.ts` to establish persistent connections
- Backend: WebSocket server handling real-time communication
- Used for: Chat messages, auction updates, player counts, resource updates

**Advantages:**
- Real-time bidirectional communication
- Lower latency than polling
- Persistent connections reduce overhead for frequent updates

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires maintaining connection state
- Can be more resource-intensive on the server
- May require fallback mechanisms for environments that block WebSockets

## Event-Driven Architecture / Pub-Sub Pattern

**Implementation:**
- Frontend: Event subscription system in `realtimeService.ts` with topics and event types
- Backend: Event publication and subscription mechanisms
- Used for: Auctions, chat, system announcements, tile updates

**Advantages:**
- Decoupled components that can evolve independently
- Scalable communication pattern for distributed systems
- Enables real-time updates without tight coupling

**Disadvantages:**
- Can be complex to debug
- Message ordering and delivery guarantees need consideration
- Potential for message loss if not implemented carefully

## Microservices Architecture

**Implementation:**
- Multiple specialized services with specific responsibilities
- API Gateway for frontend communication
- Separate services for different game functions (auctions, land management, etc.)

**Advantages:**
- Independent scaling of components
- Technology diversity where appropriate
- Isolated failures don't bring down the entire system
- Easier to develop and maintain in parallel

**Disadvantages:**
- Increased complexity in deployment and testing
- Network latency between services
- Potential data consistency challenges

## Caching

**Implementation:**
- Redis/ElastiCache mentioned in PRD for frequently accessed data
- Caching layers for high-frequency queries
- Resource state and game data caching

**Advantages:**
- Reduced database load
- Lower latency for frequent queries
- Improved user experience with faster responses

**Disadvantages:**
- Cache invalidation complexity
- Potential for stale data
- Additional infrastructure to maintain

## Message Queues

**Implementation:**
- AWS SQS mentioned as primary message queue
- Used for asynchronous job dispatch
- Handling auctions, resource updates, expansions, merges

**Advantages:**
- Asynchronous processing decouples system components
- Enhanced reliability through message persistence
- Better load distribution and handling of traffic spikes
- Enables background processing for non-urgent tasks

**Disadvantages:**
- Increased system complexity
- Additional latency for certain operations
- Requires monitoring and management of queue depths

## API Gateway Pattern

**Implementation:**
- Centralized API endpoints for frontend interactions
- Authentication and authorization at the gateway level
- Communication channel between frontend and backend services

**Advantages:**
- Single entry point simplifies frontend development
- Centralized authentication and rate limiting
- Can abstract backend service complexity

**Disadvantages:**
- Potential single point of failure
- Can become a bottleneck if not scaled properly
- May add latency to requests

## Stateless Architecture

**Implementation:**
- JWT-based authentication
- Services designed to function without session state
- State maintained in databases rather than application memory

**Advantages:**
- Easier horizontal scaling
- Better fault tolerance
- Simpler deployment and load balancing

**Disadvantages:**
- Potentially higher database load
- Slightly increased payload size with tokens
- More complex authentication flows

## Rate Limiting and Throttling

**Implementation:**
- Mentioned in authentication middleware
- Protection against abuse and overloading

**Advantages:**
- Protects system stability under load
- Prevents resource exhaustion from abusive users
- Creates fair usage policies

**Disadvantages:**
- Can impact legitimate high-volume users
- Adds complexity to request processing
- Requires tuning to balance protection vs accessibility
