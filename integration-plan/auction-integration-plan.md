# Auction System Integration Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for integrating auction functionality into the WorldOply game, allowing players to participate in auctions for tiles on the world map.

## Current Implementation Status
- ✅ Core `AuctionService` (in `src/services/auctionService.ts`) completed with API and WebSocket integration
- ✅ `useAuctionService` hook created to provide state management and error handling for components
- ✅ `AuctionTimer` component implemented for countdowns
- ✅ `Auction` component in sidebar implemented with listing and bidding functionality
- ✅ `TileInfoPanel` enhanced with auction information tab and real-time updates
- ✅ `AuctionInfo` component created for displaying auction details and bid placement
- ✅ `WorldMapOverlay` implemented with ownership visualization
- ✅ `AuctionTileOverlay` implemented with auction visualization animations
- ✅ `WorldMap` component enhanced with auction data and UI
- ✅ `Admin` section created with auction management functionality
- ✅ `AuctionCreator` component implemented for creating new auctions
- ✅ Added real-time WebSocket subscriptions throughout the app

## Upcoming UX Improvements

### 1. Notification System Enhancement
#### Current Status
- Basic notification system exists in `notificationService.ts`
- Simple notifications show for auction events

#### Planned Enhancements
- Create a dedicated `NotificationCenter` component
- Implement different notification types with custom styling:
  - Outbid alerts (high priority)
  - Auction ending soon (medium priority) 
  - Auction won/lost notifications (high priority)
  - New auction available (low priority)
- Add notification preferences in user settings
- Implement notification history view

### 2. Auction Listing Improvements
#### Current Status
- Basic auction listing in sidebar
- Limited filtering capability
- No pagination for large lists

#### Planned Enhancements
- Implement advanced filtering:
  - By tile type/biome
  - By auction status
  - By price range
  - By time remaining
- Add sorting options:
  - Ending soonest
  - Recently added
  - Lowest/highest price
- Implement pagination or infinite scroll
- Create dedicated "My Bids" view to track user's auctions
- Add auction detail view with bid history

### 3. Advanced Auction Features
#### Current Status
- Basic bidding functionality
- Manual bid placement only
- Limited auction types (mainly open English auctions)

#### Planned Enhancements
- Implement automatic bidding (proxy bidding)
  - Allow users to set maximum bid amount
  - System automatically increases bid as needed
- Add auction watchlist functionality
  - Save auctions for later viewing
  - Receive notifications for watched auctions
- Support more auction types:
  - Dutch auctions (decreasing price)
  - Sealed bid auctions
  - Reserve price auctions
- Create auction analytics dashboard for admins

### 4. Performance Optimization
#### Current Status
- Basic implementation with some performance bottlenecks
- Limited caching of auction data
- Potential WebSocket subscription overload

#### Planned Enhancements
- Implement efficient caching for auction data
- Optimize WebSocket subscription management
  - Group similar subscriptions
  - Add timeout/cleanup for inactive subscriptions
- Improve rendering performance for map overlays
  - Use clustering for dense auction areas
  - Implement viewport-based rendering optimizations
- Add loading states and skeleton UI for better perceived performance

## Implementation Priorities
1. Focus on the notification system first, as it provides immediate UX value
2. Next, implement the auction listing improvements for better user navigation
3. Add advanced auction features to increase engagement
4. Finally, address performance optimizations to ensure scalability

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for new notification and filtering components
- Integration tests for advanced bidding features
- End-to-end tests for the complete auction flow
- Performance benchmarks for WebSocket optimizations

## Possible Future Enhancements
- Auction watchlist for users to track specific auctions
- Automatic bidding (set maximum bid amount)
- Auction analytics dashboard
- Different auction types (Dutch auctions, silent auctions)
- Mobile-responsive auction interface
